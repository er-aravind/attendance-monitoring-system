## Deployment


First create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv attend
source  attend/bin/activate
```

In next step you have to install all the required packages. You can use pip for this task:

```bash
pip3 install -r  requirements.txt
```

If u have multiple pip versions ensure to use version along with command like : pip3.11 install -r requirments.txt instead of just pip3 install -r requirments.txt This will install required packages

In the final step run

```bash
python3 facerecognition.py
```
